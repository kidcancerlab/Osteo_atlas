![dim plots-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf696138-0881-4c30-b8d3-29335a43035b)


**OsteoCAR** is a comprehensive **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas** designed to facilitate **cell type annotation and transcriptomic exploration** of **osteosarcoma** across multiple models, including **human, xenograft mice, syngeneic mice, and canine samples**.  

## üî¨ **About OsteoCAR**  
- **Purpose:** Provides a harmonized reference for **annotating cell types** in osteosarcoma datasets.  
- **Scope:** Integrates data from **NIH, St. Jude, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Tufts, Colorado State University, University of Minnesota, and public datasets**.  
- **Applications:** Supports researchers in identifying **tumor subpopulations, stromal interactions, and therapeutic targets**.  

## üöÄ **Key Features**  
- **Curated Cell Type Annotations**: Enables precise classification of osteosarcoma and microenvironmental cells.  
- **Cross-Species Comparisons**: Facilitates comparative transcriptomics across human and model systems.  
- **Interactive Exploration**: Designed for seamless integration with computational tools for visualization and analysis.  

## üìä **How to Use**  
- Load and analyze **single-cell RNA-seq** datasets using **Seurat, Scanpy, or other bioinformatics pipelines**.  
- Use the atlas for **benchmarking, differential expression analysis, and pathway enrichment studies**.  
- Explore osteosarcoma **heterogeneity, immune interactions, and therapeutic vulnerabilities**.  

## ü§ù **Contributing**  
We welcome collaborations to **expand, refine, and apply** OsteoCAR to new datasets and cancer models.
