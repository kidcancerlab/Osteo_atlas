# OstEoCAR: A Single-Cell Atlas for Osteosarcoma 


**OstEoCAR** is a comprehensive **single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas** designed to facilitate **cell type annotation and transcriptomic exploration** of **osteosarcoma** across multiple models, including **human, xenograft mice, syngeneic mice, and canine samples**.  

## 🔬 **About OsteoCAR**  
- **Purpose:** Provides a harmonized reference for **annotating cell types** in osteosarcoma datasets.  
- **Scope:** Integrates data from **NIH, St. Jude, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Tufts, Colorado State University, University of Minnesota, and public datasets**.  
- **Applications:** Supports researchers in identifying **tumor subpopulations, stromal interactions, and therapeutic targets**.  

## 🚀 **Key Features**  
- **Curated Cell Type Annotations**: Enables precise classification of osteosarcoma and microenvironmental cells.  
- **Cross-Species Comparisons**: Facilitates comparative transcriptomics across human and model systems.  
- **Interactive Exploration**: Designed for seamless integration with computational tools for visualization and analysis.  

## 📊 **How to Use**  
- Load and analyze **single-cell RNA-seq** datasets using **Seurat, Scanpy, or other bioinformatics pipelines**.  
- Use the atlas for **benchmarking, differential expression analysis, and pathway enrichment studies**.  
- Explore osteosarcoma **heterogeneity, immune interactions, and therapeutic vulnerabilities**.  

## 🤝 **Contributing**  
We welcome collaborations to **expand, refine, and apply** OsteoCAR to new datasets and cancer models.
