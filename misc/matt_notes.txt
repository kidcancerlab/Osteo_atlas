2/11
What's done:
    Ran Doublet finder, created some heatmaps for calls in different objects
    Saved a list of dataframe results for each object as output/whole_object_doublet_finder_results.qs

To do:
    More polished analysis of doubletFinder
    Overlay velocity analysis with new cancer subpopulation annotations

2/25
What's done:
    Re-ran deconvolution using objects from final_tumor_vs_stroma

To do:
    Re-run ischia for cell type co-occurrence
    
3/6
Tried running Banksy for neighborhood analysis, am stuck on converting seurat object to SpatialExperiment object
2/24
What's done:
    Am in the process of overlaying velocity analysis plots with annotations and seurat clusters

To do:
    Make sure that figures were made correctly in fix_everything
    ^if so, clean up code for velocity analysis

3/3
What's done:
    Started playing around with the ranked genes from velocity analysis
        looks like it overlaps well with degs
    Re-running code to calculate fdl for all objects
    Re-running velocity analysis with mode = "dynamical"

To do:
    Make sure last two steps from above ran
    check overlap between velocity-driving genes and degs
    Recreate velocity analysis plots overlaying fdl
